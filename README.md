# Predicting the Future of Video Game Sales: Brief Overview
The vgSales.csv dataset is a collection of video game sales data spanning from 1980 to 2016. It contains information on the video game name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, North American sales, European sales, Japanese sales, other sales, and global sales. The dataset was originally sourced from VGChartz and has been widely used in data analysis and visualization projects.

This dataset is useful for exploring trends and patterns in the video game industry, such as the rise of certain platforms or genres over time, the impact of global sales on the industry, and the distribution of sales across different regions. It can also be used to identify popular publishers and individual games, and to compare sales across different platforms and regions.

# Objective
The video game industry has seen exponential growth in recent years, with more than 2.7 billion gamers worldwide and an estimated industry value of $159.3 billion in 2020. With such a large and growing market, it is crucial for game developers and publishers to understand the factors that influence video game sales and consumer preferences.

The vgSales.csv dataset contains information on video game sales, including the game's title, platform, genre, publisher, release year, and sales figures in various regions of the world. By analyzing this dataset, we can gain insights into the most popular video games, platforms, and genres, as well as the impact of different variables on sales.

Our analysis will begin by exploring the most popular video games, platforms, and genres based on sales figures. We will also investigate the regional differences in video game sales to understand which games are most popular in different regions and the factors that contribute to these differences.

Next, we will analyze the impact of different variables on video game sales, such as the game's release year, publisher, and rating. By examining these variables, we can gain insights into what factors contribute to a game's success and make recommendations for game developers and publishers to optimize their game development and marketing efforts.

Finally, we will use predictive models to estimate future video game sales based on the insights gained from our analysis. By forecasting future sales, we can provide game developers and publishers with insights into market trends and consumer preferences to guide their future game development and marketing strategies.

Overall, the objective of this analysis is to provide insights and actionable recommendations to game developers and publishers based on an analysis of video game sales data. By understanding the most popular video games, platforms, and genres, regional sales differences, and the impact of different variables on sales, we aim to help game developers and publishers optimize their game development and marketing efforts to meet consumer preferences and maximize sales.
